        <h2>THE GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST</h2>
        <p>
            The Gospel of Jesus Christ is the good news that God sent His Son to the world to save sinners. 
            Jesus, being fully God and fully man, lived a sinless life, died on the cross for our sins, 
            and rose again on the third day. Through faith in Him, we receive forgiveness and eternal life.

        <h2>CHURCH</h2>
        <p>The church is the body of Christ, a community of believers gathered in His name.</p>

        <h3>What is Church?</h3>
        <p>
            The Church is not merely a building, but the congregation of those who believe in Jesus Christ. 
            It serves as a spiritual family, a place of worship, fellowship, and teaching.
        </p>

        <h3>Purpose of the Church from the Holy Bible</h3>
        <p>
            According to the Bible, the purpose of the Church is to glorify God by worshiping Him (John 4:24), 
            spreading the gospel (Matthew 28:19-20), equipping believers (Ephesians 4:12), and serving others 
            in love (Galatians 5:13).
